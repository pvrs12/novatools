* Novatools
This is a collection of tools for reading, patching and flashing the
Novatouch TKL firmware.

See also [[http://vekkt0r.github.io/articles/novatouch-tkl-reverse-engineering-part-1/][vekkt0r.github.io]] for some more info about Novatouch keyboard reversing.

** Disclaimer
This is just a quick hack that has only been tested by me. It is very
dependent on a specific version of the firmware and if your keyboard
has another firmware things will most probably break. The checksum of
the original firmware will be checked before patching. If checksum
differs the patching will abort.

It is possible you will brick your keyboard by using these tools.

Make sure you store a copy of your original firmware safely.
** Pre-requisites
- Python2 (probably want to use a venv)
- MSP430 toolchain [on sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430mcu/)
- mspdebug OR python-msp430-tools (depending on flash method) (https://github.com/zsquareplusc/python-msp430-tools) - `pip install .`
** Flashing
The keyboard can be programmed in two ways:
1. Use JTAG or Spy-Bi-Wire (SBW) programming interface and a MSP430
   programmer (for example Launchpad).
2. Use built-in bootstrap loader (BSL) to flash via USB.

*** Flashing via JTAG / SBW
This is the most secure way of programming the keyboard since it
should always (if CM has not changed JTAG fuses lately) be possible to
read out the original firwmware and verify it's the version the
patches work against.

Connect MSP430 programmer with Spy-Bi-Wire to the GNS, TEST, RST on
the Novatouch programming connector (CN2):

#+begin_src
    +--------------------+ 
    |CN2                 | 
    ++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
 10  | | | | | | | | | |  1
     + | | + | + + + + +   
       | |   |             
       | |   +-----+ RST   
       | +---------+ TEST  
       +-----------+ GND   
#+end_src

Not sure what the name is of the connector type on the keyboard, I
just soldered wires to the pins on the backside of the connector.

*** Flashing via USB BSL
The MSP430F5510 has a built in bootstrap loader that can be used to
flash via USB. To enter the bootloader the PUR pin of the MSP must be
connected to VBUS during power up.

With stable hands it should be possible to do this without any
soldering.

1. Disconnect keyboard from computer.
2. Connect wire between pin 1 on CN1 and PUR pin on MSP (see [[http://vekkt0r.github.io/images/novatouch_pinout.png][this]]
   image for exact locations).
3. Connect keyboard to computer.
4. Disconnect wire between PUR and VBUS.
5. New USB device with VID 0x2047 / PID 0x0200 should show up on
   computer, named "Texas Instruments MSP430 USB HID Bootstrap
   Loader".

** Usage
To flash with a programmer connect keyboard (as per instructions
above) and then run:
#+begin_src
$ make flash
#+end_src

To flash with USB BSL first make sure the keyboard is in BSL mode (as
per instructions above) and then run:
#+begin_src
make -f Makefile.bsl flash
#+end_src

This will fetch the original firmware (main flash only), do some
patching, and then flash the patched firmware back to the Novatouch.

The patches done by default are:
- Replace caps-lock with ctrl
- Switch place of the 'backspace' and \ keys
- Add hook function for entering BSL (bootloader) mode with fn + F1 + F4

Edit the patch.py file to do other key mappings, hopefully it's
understandable with the overly commented code.
** Matrix
This a table representation of the actual key matrix. The row is the
lowest 3 bits of key id and the column is the 4 bits above that
(id = xCCCCRRR). I.e. ~key_id = R + (C<<3)~, where R is the 0 indexed row
from the table below and C is the 0 indexed column. For example ~tab =
5 + (2<<3) = 21~.

First row contains row id:s and first column is column id:s, rest of
the table is the keys..
